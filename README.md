Small puissance4 in terminal for play with friends

I made this small project for my course.

## Launch the puissance4

You have to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.
Then, open your terminal and write `cd path/to/the/files`. 
And, you can start the project with :
```sh
$ python3 main.py
```
Or just execute the file launch.bat (for windows) or launch.sh (for linux).

And here we go, you can start a game when you want.
